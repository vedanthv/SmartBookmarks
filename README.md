## 📍 Problem Statement
A place to organize your bookmarks in a more efficient and productive way | Official Submission for PreHackstoric by @mlhacks.
<br>
People bookmark hundreds of websites and even though there are folders in most of the browsers to arrange them
its still quite clumsy and hard to actually search for bookmarks becasue of poor organization in the browser and no search functionality.

## ⚡ Solution : 

Make a website and/or chrome extension where bookmarks can be added to a particular list: Let's say one for Coding, College, Assignments etc... and a simple yet useful search functionality that can be used to search for specific bookmarked websites.
<br>
For the frontend we would need a nice looking website : 
+ To showcase what exactly is the problem being solved
+ Features of the Website 
+ A search page and lists display page
<br><br>
### Backend Functionality:

+ A database to store all the lists and also an API to automatically update the users websites once they have bookmarked it on a browser.
+ Register/Login functionality
